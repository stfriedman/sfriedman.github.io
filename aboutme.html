										<h3><strong>About me</strong></h3>
									</header>
									<p>I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://ecology.ucdavis.edu/"> Ecology Graduate Group </a> at UC Davis in <a href="https://fishlab.ucdavis.edu/"> Dr. Peter Wainwright's </a>laboratory. I am broadly interested in the underlying ecological mechanisms that shape the evolution and diversification of marine fishes. My work combines aspects from functional morphology, phylogenetics, and comparative methods to lend insight into the selective pressures driving morphological diversification. For more information on my current research visit <a href = ""> this page </a>or contact me at the email address below.
