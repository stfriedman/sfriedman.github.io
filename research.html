									<h2>MORPHOLOGICAL DIVERSIFICATION IN BENTHIC FISHES</h2>
								</header>
					
								<div class="row">
								<div class="col-8 col-12-narrower">
									<p align="left" style="padding-right: 2em">From flattened flounder, to elongate eels, and leg-wielding frogfishes, benthic fishes exhibit a remarkable diversity of body shapes, many of which deviate strongly from the generic streamlined fish profile. Living on or within the benthos may relax the selective pressures incurred by constant midwater movement and promote complex interactions between the body and substrate, resulting in adaptations and body shapes not favored in midwater fishes. Though fishes have radiated into benthic and fossorial habitats numerous times, the phenotypic diversity of benthic fishes has never been systematically explored and compared to midwater taxa. We ask whether a benthic lifestyle results in novel body shapes and if this habitat transition leads to increased rates of morphological diversification. Using the collections at the Smithsonian Museum, we have amassed an unprecedented morphological dataset of linear measurements capturing body shape across roughly 6,000 teleost species. Applying phylogenetically-informed analyses, we show that bottom-dwelling fishes are far more dispersed in morphospace than midwater fishes. We find that benthic living both facilitates the evolution of novel body shapes and dramatically intensifies the rate of body shape evolution. This study highlights a prime example of the potential for habitat colonization to generate widespread morphological innovation and diversification. </p>

									<h2>BODY SIZE MACROEVOLUTION</h2>
								</header>
					
								<div class="row">
								<div class="col-8 col-12-narrower">
									<p align="left" style="padding-right: 2em">Understanding the causes of body shape variability across the tree of life is one of the central issues surrounding the origins of biodiversity. One potential mechanism for the generation of shape disparity is a strongly conserved relationship between size and shape. Conserved allometry has been shown to account for as much as 80% of shape variation among species of vertebrates. Here, we quantify the amount of body shape disparity attributable to changes in body size across nearly 800 species of Indo-Pacific shore fishes using a phylogenetic framework to analyze 17 geometric landmarks positioned to capture general body shape and functionally-significant features. In marked contrast to other vertebrate lineages, we find that changes in body size only explain 2.9% of the body shape variation across fishes, ranging from 3-50% within 11 of our best-sampled families. We also find a slight but significant trend of decreasing rates of shape evolution with size. Our results suggest that the influence of size on fish shape has largely been overwhelmed by lineage-specific patterns of diversification that have produced the modern landscape of highly diverse forms. </p>

									<h2>CONVERGENCE IN SURGEONFISH</h2>
								</header>
					
								<div class="row">
								<div class="col-8 col-12-narrower">
									<p align="left" style="padding-right: 2em">Morphological convergence plays a central role in the study of evolution. Often induced by shared ecological specialization, homoplasy hints at underlying selective pressures and adaptive constraints that deterministically shape the diversification of life. Although midwater zooplanktivory has arisen in adult surgeonfishes (family Acanthuridae) at least four independent times, it represents a clearly specialized state, requiring the capacity to swiftly swim in midwater locating and sucking small prey items. Whereas this diet has commonly been associated with specific functional adaptations in fishes, acanthurids present an interesting case study as all nonplanktivorous species feed by grazing on benthic algae and detritus, requiring a vastly different functional morphology that emphasizes biting behaviours. We examined the feeding morphology in 30 acanthurid species and, combined with a pre-existing phylogenetic tree, compared the fit of evolutionary models across two diet regimes: zooplanktivores and nonzooplanktivorous grazers. Accounting for phylogenetic relationships, the best-fitting model indicates that zooplanktivorous species are converging on a separate adaptive peak from their grazing relatives. Driving this bimodal landscape, zooplanktivorous acanthurids tend to develop a slender body, reduced facial features, smaller teeth and weakened jaw adductor muscles. However, despite these phenotypic changes, model fitting suggests that lineages have not yet reached the adaptive peak associated with plankton feeding even though some transitions appear to be over 10 million years old. These findings demonstrate that the selective demands of pelagic feeding promote repeated - albeit very gradual - ecomorphological convergence within surgeonfishes, while allowing local divergences between closely related species, contributing to the overall diversity of the clade. </p>
